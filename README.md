# Midnight-Place-Network
<p>This project is designed to demonstrate my professional front-end development skills to a potential employer. 
But who knows, maybe as my programming skills grow, this project will turn into something more than the presentation. At least, I really hope so...</p>

<p>The main technologies in this project are <ins>React</ins> and <ins>Redux</ins>. 
But there are many related technologies, such as <ins>ajax</ins>, <ins>react hooks</ins>, <ins>redux form</ins>, <ins>SPA</ins>, <ins>FLUX</ins>, <ins>REST</ins>, and more.</p>

<p>At this point, you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in with test account (email: <b>midnight_place_test@mail.ru</b>, password: <b>MidnightTest</b> (if you failed several times, you will see a captcha))</li>
<li>Change your avatar, status and other additional information</li>
<li>Find some people by name or ID and check their accounts</li>
<li>Follow/unfollow some people</li>
<li>Try validate mechanics</li>
<li>Try a prototype of the future post function</li>
  <li>Take a look at the code to see my approach and comments on them</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy this place.</p>
<p>Let's go! For the glory of coding</p>
